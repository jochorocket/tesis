\begin{abstract}

This thesis presents a set of modifications to the \ac{QIEA}-$\mathbb{R}$ algorithm, which are based both on a separation of the action range of the quantum individuals operating, and the implementation of a crossover operator intended to modify quantum individuals rather than classical individuals. The mentioned algorithms are tested on a set of benchmark functions in the search for improvements in both quality data generation and convergence during the execution of the afforementioned.
