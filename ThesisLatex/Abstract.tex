This thesis presents a set of modifications to the \ac{QIEA}-$\mathbb{R}$ algorithm, which are based both on a separation of the action range of the quantum individuals operating, and the implementation of a crossover operator intended to modify quantum individuals rather than classical individuals. The mentioned algorithms are tested on a set of benchmark functions in the search for improvements in both quality data generation and convergence during the execution of the afforementioned. Results obtained show an improvement of the convergence speed in algorithms implementing the proposed crossover operator on testing scenarios when a reduced number of classical individuals per quantum individual is produced per iteration.
