In this thesis, a multi-population parallelized evolution modification of the \ac{QIEA} for $\mathbb{R}$ is proposed. This modification introduces a crossover operator based on the concept of \textit{entanglement} at an intergenerational level among different populations of quantum individuals, with the purpose of applying the improvements obtained by a certain individual to another yet evolutioned individual after a certain number of iterations, so in this way we become able to minimize the risk of convergence towards a local optimal solution.
