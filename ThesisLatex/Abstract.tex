In this thesis, a modification of the \ac{QIEA} $\mathbb{R}$ is proposed. This modification introduces a crossover operator through the concept of entanglement at an intergenerational level among different populations of quantum individuals parallely evolving, with the purpose of applying the improvements obtained by a certain individual to another yet evolutioned individual after a certain number of iterations, and minimize the risk of convergence towards a local optimal solution. The objective is to get more robust, global-oriented solutions.
